## **Introduction**
#### **Definition of Big Data:**  
Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from. or otherwise deal with data sets that are too ***large*** or ***complex*** to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
#### **Characteristics of Big Data: Vs**  
* Volume (Scale):  A large number of data is being generated every day.
* Variety (Complexity): There are different types of data.
* Velocity (Speed): It measures how fast the data is coming in.
* Veracity: Data quality issues are particularly challenging in a big data context. Data should be cleaned firstly, then be processed.
* Value: Ultimately, big data is meaningless if it does not provide value toward some meaningful goal.
* Visibility (Visualization)
* Variability: Refers to data whose meaning is constantly changing. It defines the need to get meaningful data considering all possible circumstances.
* Viscosity: It is used to describe the latency or lag time in the data relative to the event being described.
* Volatility: Refers to how long is data valid and how long should it be stored.
* And there will be more Vs in the future...
